## The sim's shared vocabulary: the core constants (including GameVersion
## and its changelog), the gameplay/wire types, the process-wide map
## dimension globals, and the pure helpers both sides of every seam need —
## split out of sim.nim (docs/plans/2026-08-01-sim-split.md) so the leaf
## modules (rig_art, arena, map_art, sim_config, sim_state, roster) share
## them without importing gameplay. Leaf modules may declare their own
## section-local consts/types; anything two modules need lives here.
##
## MOVED VERBATIM from sim.nim: SimServer and friends are flatty-serialized
## POSITIONALLY into replay keyframes, so declaration/field order here is
## wire format — reorder nothing without a GameVersion bump.

    ## The fork restarts the changelog. Eight cogs, four RED against four
    ## BLUE, one walled arena, one hitscan gun, three hit points and a
    ## two-second respawn. A cog sees only its own 90-degree cone (45 deg
    ## either side of its AIM) out to 1575px plus a 90px bubble; walls block
    ## both, glass does not. Scoring is per cog
    ## `net = frags - teamFrags - deaths`, summed per team, and the margin
    ## drives `gameScorePermille` at `DecisiveMargin = 12`, so a RED seat and
    ## a BLUE seat score sums to exactly 1.000. Full time, the engine wall
    ## clock, or a fault are the only ways an episode ends: `mercy` and
    ## `wipe` are gone with the objective that produced them.
