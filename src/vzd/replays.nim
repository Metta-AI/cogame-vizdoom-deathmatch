      ## ticks of gap and re-simulated all of them inside ONE presentation
      ## frame, so the viewer showed nothing for seconds and the
      ## viewer-check's 50 % clock probe read identically to its 0 % probe.

      ## When on, playback fast-forwards through the lull spans below. ON for

      ## jarring than watching it.

      ## Full-match flag-story beats (steal/return/capture) plus the terminal
      ## gameover verdict, exactly as `stepEvents` emits them, precomputed on

      ## The final game's earned achievements with their focus cogs
      ## ([{"id", "s" (seat slot), "n" (address)}]), read off the scan sim
      ## after its walk crossed finishGame. Shipped once with the lead

    scan: ReplayScan
      ## The in-flight whole-match precompute walk, nil when finished (and
